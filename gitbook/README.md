# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, friends

Hey, welcome to our Homelab Wiki â€“ the place where all the magic happens! We're hosting two awesome projects here: XFGN (our cool internal hobby thing) and A Gamers Grind (the place where gaming dreams come true).

Ready for the grand tour? Here's what you'll find in our wiki:

1. **Policies and Procedures:** We got rules, man! Check out how we handle passwords, create and delete services â€“ all the important stuff to keep things running smooth and safe.
2. **Service Overviews:** Geek alert! Get ready to dive into the nitty-gritty of the services we're hosting. Config files, ports, and techy goodness await!
3. **Game Server Documentation:** Gamers, this one's for you! We've got tips and templates to help you rock those game servers like a pro.
4. **Processes:** Curious about how we do stuff around here? Learn how we create new virtual machines and handle patch days with ease.
5. **Troubleshooting:** Tech gremlins, beware! We've battled them too, and we've got guides to help you kick their pixelated butts.
6. **Guides:** Wanna be like us? Our guides will show you how to set up your own awesome homelab. Let's build it together! Oh, and here's the best part: you can also submit your own changes and improvements to the documentation. We're all ears for your genius ideas!

We're stoked to have you here. This wiki is all about sharing knowledge, so feel free to explore, contribute, and have a blast!

Time to geek out and have some fun! ðŸš€
