## The Scenario

Our goal is to import our domain into CF, or purchase one through them. This allows us to manage DNS via Cloudflare, which enables the Dynamic DNS container and Tunnels

### Prerequisites

* An existing domain or money to buy one
* A Cloudflare Account

## Setting up your Domain

### Existing Domain

_Manage your existing domain via Cloudflare_

#### Migrate registrar to Cloudflare (recommended)

_If your domain is registered with a different party but you don't have anything set up (eg email), this is the best path to take_

#### Forward your DNS&#x20;

_If your domain is registred through a different party and you have configured services on it (such as email) or Cloudflare is more expensive, this is the recommended path_



### New Domain

_Purchase a new domain through Cloudflare_
