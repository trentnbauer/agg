# GitOps / GitHub

[Link to App](https://github.com/trentnbauer/agg.local)

GitOps gives you tools and a framework to take DevOps practices, like collaboration, CI/CD, and version control, and apply them to infrastructure automation and application deployment. Developers can work in the code repositories they already know, while operations can put the other necessary pieces into place.
