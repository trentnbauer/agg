# ðŸ—‚ Internal Doco

> ### _**Isn't this overkill?**_

Yeah - definitely. Why am I doing it? Great question!

I want my Homelab to be well documented for 2 reasons, the main being the [Bus Factor](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxdUkLXC2WIXVe3e7-N4sBFwfF-XHWZeui). I also enjoy sharing this hobby with others and having things written and drawn allows me to do so while reducing the risk of an inexperienced person breaking something permanently.

This documentation is intended for internal use though I have made it public as there are tid-bits of useful information for others to use in their homelabs.

I do also manage [another documentation site](https://docs.agamersgrind.com) which is more focused towards guides for public use
