# Issue and Project Tracking

Projects and issues are tracked on the [AGG / XFGN Trello](https://trello.com/w/agamersgrindxfgn) or in the [AGG Discord](https://discord.agamersgrind.com)

Refer to the [Trello](../service-overviews/other-adhoc-apps/trello.md) page for more information regarding how things are tracked, tags etc.

## Game Servers <a href="#bkmrk-game-servers" id="bkmrk-game-servers"></a>

AGG is primarily focused on hosting game servers for public use. Any changes to this Trello board is sent to the [Alerts Discord page](https://discord.com/channels/1112671736090066976/1112673487308460112)

### New and coming Servers

Planned, in progress and completed servers are tracked on the dedicated ['Game Servers' board.](https://trello.com/b/cyarYq2T/game-servers) This includes server updates / upgrades.

Players can request game servers in the Discord group, under the ['request-a-server' forum](https://discord.com/channels/1112671736090066976/1112676695787458590) on Discord. These requests are reviewed by the AGG moderators. If approved, a card will be created on the Trello board and a link provided in the Discord forum post.

### Removed Servers

Sometimes we have to remove servers. These are tracked in the ['removed servers' forum](https://discord.com/channels/1112671736090066976/1113263066210127933) on Discord and will, where possible, provide files for players to keep player (such as map files for a Minecraft server).

I prefer to leave servers inactive than remove them, though removing them is sometimes required to make compute room for new projects. Generally, a server will only be shutdown under 2 conditions;

* Community Vote\
  The community has voted for the creation of another server instead (moving compute elsewhere)
* Inactive Server\
  The server is 'dead' (no players) and has been for a long time

### Issues

#### Player related issues

Player related issues are tracked on the ['Support' form](https://discord.com/channels/1112671736090066976/1112673830071181343) in Discord. This allows members to easily report any issues they experience

Some examples of player issues are

* Player stuck somewhere and needs help getting out
* Disputing a ban
* Reporting another player

_Sometimes a player will report a server issue, which will be migrated to the Trello board for resolution tracking_

#### Server issues

Server issues are tracked on the ['Game Server' board](https://trello.com/b/cyarYq2T/game-servers)

Some examples of server issues are

* Crashes
* Poor Performance

### **Why?**

This allows us to be up front and public with issues and future projects. Followers can comment and make suggestions towards future servers
