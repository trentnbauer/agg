# An Introduction...

Parts of this documentation could be placed under public or internal doco.

As this is mostly written for myself / handover of my infrastructure, I've left it under internal.

You may find helpful information in here but it will all be specific to MY network. Take it all with a grain of salt.

With that... fun have!
