# A few things to note...

> ### _**Isn't this overkill?**_

Yeah - definitely. Why am I doing it? Great question!

I want my Homelab to be well documented for 2 reasons, the main being the [Bus Factor](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxdUkLXC2WIXVe3e7-N4sBFwfF-XHWZeui). I also enjoy sharing this hobby with others and having things written and drawn allows me to do so while reducing the risk of an inexperienced person breaking something permanently.

## _**A few to note;**_

### Common acronyms and words

* Compute - CPU and RAM
* Homelab - A server or server-like environment physically located in a persons home, used for hobby, testing or educational purposes
* Container - A Docker container (which has all the files and folders required to run an app and is OS agnostic)
* Any pages with a question mark icon are incomplete

### **Credentials**

* When Bitwarden is referenced, 99% of the time it is the Bitwarden organization 'XFGN/aGG'
* All internal and external credentials are saved in the Bitwarden organization
* My Bitwarden account is secured behind 2 FIDO keys
  * One on my keychain
  * The other is stored inside Macaroni
* I have enabled 'emergency takeover' on my vault, with the below people having access
  * Mia W

### Example files

Some of our doco will contain docker-compose files or example config files. These are provided as-is and are not actively monitored or maintained. While they may have worked when the documentation was written they may not work in the future.

_Unfortunately I'm unable to get the GitHub sync to work, so the files are not my live production files._
