To A Gamers Grind: Public Files

## What is this repo?
This repo was created to house internal documents and knowledge alongside our [GitBooks site](https://docs.xfgn.dev)
Our main GitHub is private but there are some files we wish to share with the public that are stored here instead, such as Compose files* and game server configs.

## Support
We do provide some support, you can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.agamersgrind.com)

*The compose files stored here are not our production files and may need to be tweaked for your use-case. They may also not be current vs our infrastructure.
