## What is this repo?
This repo was created to house internal documents and knowledge alongside our [GitBooks site](https://docs.xfgn.dev)
Our main GitHub is private but there are some files we wish to share with the public that are stored here instead, such as Docker-Compose files and game server configs.
We use a sync action to sync certain files between the our private and this public repo.

## Support
We do provide minimal support, you can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.agamersgrind.com)
